# The Road That

Create an endless, lane-based runner experience called The Road That Remembers.
The player runs continuously along a strange, grounded, non-technological road through varied natural and human landscapes (orchards, bridges, storms, fields, river-fords, herds, ruins, traveling strangers). The runner never pauses for menus. Story choices appear as brief, poetic prompts tied to the three lanes (left/center/right). Each lane represents a consistent mode of being (carrying/aid, discipline/line-holding, hunger/advantage). Choices immediately affect the feel of the run (pace weight, obstacle density, lane safety, reward types) and recur later as consequences embedded into terrain and encounters (helpers appear, hazards evolve, routes change). Early levels are slower and spacious to teach multitasking between movement and meaning; later levels compress decision windows and increase obstacle complexity, forcing narrative composure under pressure. The tone is intimate, eerie, and consequence-driven, avoiding fantasy cliches and plot tropes. The world feels like it remembers the player’s patterns and responds without exposition.
